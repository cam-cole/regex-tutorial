Hello, everyone! My name is Cameron and today we are going to learn about regular expressions a.k.a regex.

## Summary

The regular expression we are covering today is matching an email - 

`/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`

In this tutorial, we will break down each component of the regex above and explain how this expression allows us to search for all email addresses in a body of text.
